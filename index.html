            <h3>Rainbows</h3>
                <img src = 'Rainbows.jpg' alt = 'Rainbows'>
                <p>
                    Rainbows Drive-In is an iconic stop in the Waikiki area, serving plate lunches to the area since 1961.
                    I plan on eating here at least a few times during my week long stay.
                </p>
            <h3>Leonard's Bakery</h3>
                <img src = 'leonards.png' alt = 'Leonards'>
                <p>
                    Leonard's Bakery is a famous landmark in the Honolulu area, serving malasadas and other amazing
                    baked goods since 1952. Malasadas are a Portuguese donut that melts in your mouth. It's a must visit
                    to anyone visiting the area.
                </p>
            <h3>Duke's</h3>
                <img src = 'dukes.jpg' alt = 'Dukes'>
                <p>
                    Duke's is a beachfront restaurant right on the beach of Waikiki. It's well known for it's laid back atmosphere
                    and amazing selection of tropical foods and drinks. This is actually the first time I will be visiting
                    since I turned 21!
                </p>
        <h2>Hot Spots</h2>
            <h3>Waikiki Beach</h3>
                <img src = 'waikiki-beach.jpg' alt = 'Waikiki Beach'>
                <p>
                    I will be staying with family at the Royal Hawaiian located on Waikiki Beach. It is one of the more well
                    known beaches in Honolulu, especially when it comes to tourism. I haven't been in almost 15 years but
                    there is always something going on nearby and with the Hawaiian weather, there doesn't need to be
                    in order to have a good time.
                </p>
            <h3>Swap Meet</h3>
                <img src = 'SwapMeet.jpg' alt = 'Swap Meet'>
                <p>
                    Swap meets are kind of a norm in Hawaiian life. If you are unfamiliar with the term, it's
                    basically a flea market. People come in, set up tents with handmade or foreign bought goods,
                    and sell them for whatever they think it's worth. It's a fun experience and you can get some
                    really cool things for good prices.
                </p>
            <h3>Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center</h3>
                <img src = 'RHC.jpg' alt = 'Royal Hawaiian'>
                <p>
                    The Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center used to be a small swap meet style shopping area, but
                    in recent years it has turned into the big luxury shopping area. It has a lot of popular
                    brand names and has grown in size as the years have gone by.
                </p>
        <h2>Family</h2>
            <img src = 'family.jpg' alt = 'Family'>
            <p>
                This a picture of a small (seriously) poriton of my family living on the islands. I meet new
                family members every time I go, so it'll be interesting to see how they've been doing in the
                years I have been gone. I will most likely see everyone in this picture.
